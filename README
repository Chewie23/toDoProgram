A To Do list. Maybe even a bullet journal thingie

The features:
1) Daily tasks
2) Weekly tasks
3) Monthly tasks

Nice to haves:
1) Analysis of tasks done
	a) Graphs/stats of average and so forth
2) GUI
	a) crossed off tasks

This requires dates, SQL to store data and various get/set commands to...get and set data. Maybe try to implement a GUI if I feel froggy (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML and what have you)

I feel this will be a big project since I won't stop polishing it up

But I think it will be good. Definitely need to start making using my GitHub to store and pull and push from various computers
