A To Do list. Maybe even a bullet journal thingie

The design doc:
Have a SQL database to set/get entries. Would need various tables/columns
for to do, and completed. Also dates to catalog. And a way to have completed
tasks go back to open, in case

The features:
1) Add
2) Delete
3) Ability to preview tasks
	a) Daily
	b) Weekly
	c) Monthly
4) Review completed tasks
	a) Conversely, undo a completed task to be open


Nice to haves:
1) Analysis of tasks done
	a) Graphs/stats of average and so forth
2) GUI
	a) crossed off tasks
3) Convert to a Bullet Journal?
	a) This may be too much?
4) Repeat tasks if multiple throughout various times?

Questions:
1) How to organize the different API's/SQL calls? 
	a) In terms of Go?
	b) In terms of MySQL?

Comments:
This requires dates, SQL to store data and various get/set commands to...get and set data. Maybe try to implement a GUI if I feel froggy (i.e. JavaScript, CSS, HTML and what have you)

I feel this will be a big project since I won't stop polishing it up

But I think it will be good. Definitely need to start making using my GitHub to store and pull and push from various computers
